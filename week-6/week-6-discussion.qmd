### Ternary Plots

3 variables - simultaneous comparisons

Radar plots/ Spider chart

more customizable than a ternary plot

multi-scale and pattern comparisons simultaneously

1 unit of measurement

Sunburst/ radial treemap

proportional contributions of different categories within a hierarchy

useful for exploratory data

you can zoom in and out of sunburst plots

circle thing you want to analyze further and follow up with that

Heatmap

using color to emphasize differences

useful for diverging data types

Sankey diagrams

depicts the flow of values, transition of dominance, and increase/decreases

Treemap plots

good for simple pattern spotting, hierarchical comparisons, and proportional visualizations
