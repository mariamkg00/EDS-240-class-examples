graphic layers

1.  data (in tidy format) and defining aesthetics
2.  geometric objects (aka geoms) - define the type of plots
3.  statistical transforations
4.  position adjustments
5.  coordinate systems
6.  facet

Enhance communication using additional layers

1.  labels - add/update titles, axis/legend labels
2.  annotations - add textual lables
3.  scales - update how the aesthetic mappings manifest visually
4.  themes - customize the non-data elements of your plot
5.  layout - combine multiple plots into the same graphic
